# TASK 46 — `highestContiguousServerSeq` never advances on real Postgres: `int8` arrives as a string
**Status:** in-review
**Priority:** **HIGH** — a silent, total failure of the server-side projection watermark on the production engine. Fails *quiet*, not closed: no error, no red test, the watermark simply never moves.
**Depends on:** 08

## Goal

Make the contiguous-serverSeq walk work on the engine production actually runs on, and close the reason every existing test lane is blind to it.

## The bug

`packages/core/src/projection/oplog-source.ts:167-181`:

```ts
const result = await sql<{ serverSeq: number }>`      // ← the type is ASSERTED, not derived
  SELECT server_seq AS server_seq FROM operations
  WHERE server_seq > ${from} ORDER BY server_seq
`.execute(db);
for (const row of result.rows) {
  if (row.serverSeq === watermark + 1) {              // "1" === 1  →  false. Forever.
    watermark = row.serverSeq;
```

`operations.server_seq` is `bigint` (`10-db §3`). The **real `pg` driver returns `int8` as a string** — int8 exceeds JS's safe integer range, so node-postgres refuses to lossily coerce it. Strict `===` therefore never matches, the loop breaks at the first row, and the function returns `from` unchanged.

**Verified empirically by the orchestrator on real PostgreSQL 16.14** (not reasoned about):

```
bigint -> value="1"  typeof=string
int4   -> value=1    typeof=number
THE COMPARISON: (row.serverSeq === watermark + 1) with watermark=0  ->  false
```

**Consequence:** `applied_server_seq` never advances server-side. Every server projection stays pinned at its starting watermark. Task 17 consumes this path; task 16 had to route its PG16 test around it (advancing the watermark via the store directly, and saying so).

**The TypeScript annotation is part of the bug.** `sql<{ serverSeq: number }>` is a raw-SQL type assertion — the compiler believes it and typechecks clean. This is the same family as task 39 (`DB` is `any` across `apps/server`): *a type that was declared rather than derived tells you nothing about runtime.*

## Why every lane missed it — the part worth more than the fix

| lane | driver | `int8` returns |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| `@bolusi/core` unit tests | better-sqlite3 | **number** |
| applier-conformance (the **T-8 both-engine gate**) | PGlite | **number** |
| production + `test:rls` | **real `pg`** | **string** ← the only one that reproduces |

**The both-engine gate cannot catch this, by construction.** T-8 exists to prove appliers are dialect-neutral, and it does — but it proves *SQL dialect* neutrality, not *driver marshalling* equivalence. **PGlite is not a faithful proxy for `pg`.** It embeds a real PostgreSQL, so the SQL is honest; but it is a different client, and the client is what decides what JS type you get back. So a gate labelled "SQLite **vs Postgres**" is really "SQLite vs *a* Postgres, over a driver production never uses."

Recorded as **testing-guide T-14f**. Note the near-miss that makes the point: review-03, reviewing task 11, spotted this exact mechanism — *"the `Number()` comment overstates its evidence: through PGlite it comes back as a number… it IS load-bearing against the real `pg` driver"* — and correctly sized the instance it was looking at as a **nit**, because task 11's `watermarks.ts` **does** carry the `Number()` cast (lines 82-83) and was therefore safe. The mechanism was identified; the **class** was never swept. One function had the cast; the neighbouring one did not.

## Docs to read

- `packages/core/src/projection/oplog-source.ts` :167-181 (the walk) — and `watermarks.ts` :76-83, which already does this correctly and whose comment explains why. Read both together; the fix already exists, twelve lines away.
- `packages/core/src/projection/oracle.ts:59` — the existing precedent for the *safe* shape: `value <= MAX_SAFE && value >= -MAX_SAFE ? Number(value) : value.toString()`. Decide whether the walk needs that or plain `Number()`, and say why.
- `04-module-contract.md` §4.3 (contiguity semantics), `10-db-schema.md` §3 (`server_seq bigint`, gapless per tenant), §9.1 (the watermark scalars).
- `testing-guide.md` **T-8** (the both-engine rule this task amends), **T-14f** (this incident), T-13 (interrogate the oracle), T-12 (the class, not the instance).
- `ai-docs/tasks/42-*.md` — the related `Number()` comment nit from the same mechanism.

## Skills

- `superpowers:test-driven-development`, `superpowers:verification-before-completion`.
- Worktree isolation per CLAUDE.md §2.3 — first step: `git branch --show-current`; STOP if on `main`.
- **Real Postgres required.** PGlite cannot reproduce this — that is the whole point. Use the per-worktree lane (task 34): `pnpm db:up`, then confirm the run printed `attribution OK … owned by '<your project>'` before believing any number (T-14d).

## Files / modules touched

- `packages/core/src/projection/oplog-source.ts`. **`@bolusi/core` is contended (CLAUDE.md §4)** — serialize.
- `packages/core/test/projection/**` + possibly a new real-`pg` lane (see Acceptance).
- `ai-docs/testing-guide.md` T-8 — doc-first if the both-engine rule's wording changes.

## Acceptance

**Observable done-condition:** a test running against **real `pg`** proves the watermark advances across a contiguous run — and fails if the cast is removed.

- **Reproduce first** (T-11): on real PG16, call `highestContiguousServerSeq(db, 0)` with contiguous ops at server_seq 1,2,3 and watch it return **0**. That silent zero is the bug. If it returns 3, the premise is wrong — stop and report.
- **Fix the walk.** Justify `Number()` vs `oracle.ts:59`'s safe shape: `server_seq` realistically stays under 2^53, but `bigint` was chosen deliberately and a silent lossy coercion at 2^53 would be this same bug wearing a different hat. State the reasoning in the code, and make the claim one a test can check.
- **Falsify** (§2.11): remove the cast → the real-`pg` test goes red (watermark 0 instead of 3); restore → green. **A test that only runs on PGlite/SQLite cannot go red here** — if your new test passes with the cast removed, you have written the bug's own alibi. Prove it fails.
- **SWEEP THE CLASS — this is the deliverable, not the one-line fix** (T-12). Enumerate **every** raw-`sql<{...: number}>` read of an `int8`/`bigint` column in `@bolusi/core` and `@bolusi/db-server`, and every place a `bigint` crosses into JS arithmetic or `===`. `watermarks.ts` is safe; `oplog-source.ts` was not; **name the total and the verdict for each** (T-14 — a sweep must assert its own denominator). Any raw-SQL result type asserting `number` over an int8 column is this bug, present or latent.
- **Close the lane gap, or state plainly why not.** The reason this shipped is that **no test lane uses the production driver**. Either add a real-`pg` leg to the projection suite (the `test:rls` lane already has attributed real PG16), or record explicitly in T-8 that the both-engine gate does **not** cover driver marshalling and name what does. Do not leave the gate implying a coverage it lacks — that is the exact failure this repo has now shipped nine times.
- `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:rls` (real PG16, attributed), `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` green. **Read the output, not the exit code** (§2.1).

## Outcome

Reproduced on real PG 16.14 (attributed): the walk returned **0** over contiguous ops at 1,2,3. Fixed by
widening the raw-SQL annotation to the drivers' truth (`Int8Value = string | number | bigint`) and
normalising through one seam, `packages/core/src/projection/int8.ts`. The walk now runs in **bigint** and
narrows exactly once on the way out, so it is exact over the column's range and a value past 2^53 throws
instead of rounding. `watermarks.ts` was moved onto the same seam: it was right about the live bug and
silently lossy at 2^53, and a per-call-site convention is what let the neighbouring function ship without
it (CLAUDE.md §2.8).

Lane gap closed by construction: `packages/db-server/test/projection-int8-marshalling.test.ts` runs the
walk on the **real `pg` driver** via `pnpm test:rls`. It asserts its own coverage (T-14) — the int8-arrives-
as-string precondition is a test, so the file fails loudly the day that stops being true rather than
going green for the wrong reason. Falsified: cast removed → 4 red on real PG16, green on PGlite with the
bug fully present. T-8 + §2.4 amended to state the gate covers dialect, not driver marshalling.

### Residual finding — NOT fixed here, needs an owner (task 17 is the natural one)

`oplog-source.ts`'s `RawOpRow` / `reconstructOperation` is **client-shaped by construction** and cannot
read the SERVER op log as written — three divergences, not one:

| field | client (SQLite) | server (10-db §5) | asserted | on real `pg` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seq`, `timestamp_ms` | INTEGER → number | `bigint` | `number` | string → `"10" < "9"` is **true**, canonical order silently inverts past seq 9 |
| `payload`, `location` | `text` | `jsonb` | `string` | driver returns a parsed **object**; `JSON.parse(object)` throws |
| `agent_initiated` | `integer` 0/1 | `boolean` | `number` | `false !== 0` → **every op reads back agent-initiated** |

Not reachable today (`apps/server` does not wire the projection engine; task 17 is `todo`), which is why it
is reported rather than half-fixed: casting only the int8 half would leave the other two broken while
implying a server-readiness that does not exist — the same "gate implying coverage it lacks" failure. The
real question is a design one: does server projection read the server op log through this function at all,
given jsonb/boolean? The applier-conformance fixture models the CLIENT DDL verbatim, so T-8 will not answer it.

## Note

Found by task 16, which probed the production engine directly instead of trusting its green PGlite suite, and **correctly declined to fix it** — `@bolusi/core` was contended with task 14 live (§4/§6). It routed its own PG16 test around the broken function and said so in its report rather than quietly using the workaround as evidence.

The uncomfortable summary: this bug survived task 08's implementation, task 08's review (200 convergence checks), task 11's implementation, task 11's review — which *identified the exact mechanism* and sized the instance in front of it correctly — and the orchestrator's own merge verification of both. It survived because **every one of those greens came from an engine that isn't the one that runs in production**, and nobody asked what the gate's "Postgres" actually was until someone connected the real driver.
