# TASK 137 — the composition root is structurally unguarded (one test mounts `Root`, with substituted factories) and the knip gate cannot see unused FILES

**Status:** todo
**Priority:** MEDIUM — this is the **cause** of tasks 122/133/134/135/136, not another instance of them. Both halves are guard blindness: nothing observes production wiring, and the sweep that exists to catch dead code has dead files outside its denominator.
**Depends on:** —
**Blocks:** —
**SEC ids owned by THIS task:** none.
**Filed by:** QA test-honesty sweep, 2026-07-22.

## Half A — `Root.tsx`'s wiring decisions are unobservable

`apps/mobile/test/live-shell-support.tsx`'s `mountRoot` is the **sole** `<Root>` render in the repo. It passes **no** `createSync`, **no** `createMedia`, and a `createNotes` that takes 3 parameters and hardcodes `media: UNWIRED_NOTES_MEDIA` — production's takes 4 and calls `notesMediaSeamsFor(media)`. Demonstrated consequences (both reverted):

- **Media→notes binding.** `Root.tsx:164-176`'s own comment cites §2.11 and predicts *"the honest answer to 'if this binding were wrong, what would notice?' would be 'nothing'"*. Passing `null` instead of `media` and dropping `media` from the effect deps → **62/62 files, 569/569 tests, EXIT=0**. The comment's prediction is correct.
- **Permission bootstrap.** Deleting `await enroll.evaluator.prime()` (02-permissions §6) **and** the `onBundleRefresh` memo-invalidation argument (§6 (a)) → **62/62, 569/569, EXIT=0**.

`apps/mobile/index.ts` has no test importing it at all (task 136 corrupted its production binding to throw → zero failures).

**Deliverable A:** a composed harness that mounts `Root` with the **production** factories over fake PORTS (the platform-free-core design exists for exactly this — the web visual harness already does it). Every wiring decision above must have a test that reds when the decision is broken. Report each falsification individually.

## Half B — `pnpm knip` reads unused EXPORTS and never unused FILES

`scripts/check-unused-exports.mjs:79-83` iterates `issue.exports` only; `issue.files` is never read, and `KNIP_ARGS` is `--production --include exports`. knip classifies a file unreachable from the entry as a **file** issue with `exports: []`, so its symbols are never enumerated. Result: `pnpm knip` → `119 unused exports (baseline 119) … sweep is not blind` / `EXIT=0` while `grep -c "push/registration\|push/routes\|shell-session\|user-workspaces" knip-baseline.json` → **0**. The dead files behind 133/135 are invisible to the gate that exists to catch them — a guard whose failure mode is "silently checks nothing" (§2.11).

Running knip *without* `--include exports` lists them plainly: `push/registration.ts`, `push/routes.ts`, `session/shell-session.ts`, `state/user-workspaces.ts`.

**Deliverable B:** extend the gate to read `issue.files` with its own baseline, so an unreachable production file fails the sweep the way an unused export does. **`apps/server`'s file list from that run is noise** — its configured entries (`src/index.ts`/`main.ts`) don't match how knip resolves that workspace, so everything shows unused; fix the server entry config first or the new gate will be all-red and get muted, which is the worse failure. `apps/mobile`'s resolution is sound (`src/i18n.ts` is correctly not listed) — verify that before believing any list.

## FALSIFY (§2.11 — REPORT it)
- Half A: for each guarded decision, break it → the new composed test reds; restore → green. A harness that passes against a blank mount proves nothing (T-14: assert real content).
- Half B: add a throwaway unreachable production file → the file gate reds and names it; delete it → green. And confirm the export half still reds on a new unused export (don't trade one blindness for another).
