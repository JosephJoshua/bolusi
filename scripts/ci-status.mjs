// `pnpm ci:status` — read `main`'s ACTUAL CI result, per job, and say which reds are owed and which
// are news. Deliverable 4 of task 142: "read `gh run list` after pushing to main" as a command you
// run, not an intention you hold.
//
// WHY A COMMAND AND NOT A CHECKLIST LINE
// -------------------------------------
// `main`'s CI was red for 30+ consecutive runs across more than a day. The information was one
// `gh run list` away the whole time. A checklist line saying "check CI" had the same failure mode as
// the local gates it sat beside: it was obeyed as written and answered a different question.
// This prints the per-JOB breakdown, which is the level at which the three hidden causes were
// visible, and it labels the two reds that are NOT news so the ones that are cannot hide behind
// them.
//
// OWED COMES FROM ONE PLACE
// -------------------------
// The expected-red set is not restated here. It is derived from `STEP_POLICY` + `EXPECTED` in
// scripts/ci-parity.mjs — the same two tables `pnpm verify` classifies against — so a red that is
// excused locally and a red that is excused here cannot disagree. There is one expected-red
// category, OWED (D21's SEC allowlist); every other red is UNEXPECTED, a regression to read.
//
// ANY FAILURE TO *READ* IS A FAILURE, NEVER A SKIP
// ------------------------------------------------
// No `gh`, no auth, no runs, an unparseable response: each exits non-zero with the tool's own
// output. A status reader that returns "nothing to report" when it could not look is the exact
// green-for-the-wrong-reason shape CLAUDE.md §2.11 catalogues.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHICH QUESTION IT ANSWERED (task 154)
// ------------------------------------------------
// `gh run list --branch main` returns whatever ran most recently ON THAT BRANCH. That is NOT "did CI
// run my commit": a push whose run has not been created yet, a run on a task branch, and a manual
// dispatch are all invisible to it, and each would read as "main is clean" to someone who wanted
// "my work is clean". The gap is small and the misreading is easy, which is precisely the shape of
// the original outage — a check obeyed as written that answered a different question. So the scope
// is printed in the command's OWN output, every run's head SHA is shown, the local HEAD is compared
// against them, and `--sha=<sha>` turns "I want THIS commit" into a requirement that fails when the
// commit is absent instead of passing on a neighbour's green.
