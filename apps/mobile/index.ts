/**
 * The registered root.
 *
 * `Root` (src/bootstrap/Root.tsx) is the composition root; its header states exactly what is real,
 * what is a seam, and what is not built yet — read it before wiring task 15. `App` is deliberately
 * NOT registered directly any more: it takes every input as a prop so it stays drivable from fakes,
 * which means something has to supply them, and that something is `Root`.
 *
 * DEVICE INFO IS DERIVED FROM PERSISTED STATE (task 94), not a literal. Every field except
 * `platform`/`appVersion` is a fact the SERVER establishes: `api/02-auth` §4.3's enroll response
 * carries the deviceId, tenant and store; enrollment persists the ids to meta_kv (task 88) and the
 * NAMES alongside them (bootstrap/device-info.ts). So `readDeviceInfo` reads the real identity of an
 * enrolled device here, and returns the honest empty block for a device that has not enrolled yet —
 * never a plausible-looking placeholder that has nothing to do with the device row an owner is about
 * to revoke. `appVersion` stays `''`: `expo-constants` is not pinned in 08 §2.2, and pinning it is a
 * spec-table change that needs a stop-and-ask (CLAUDE.md §4/§6) — deferred, see
 * `decisions/2026-07-20-appversion-source.md`, and left empty rather than faked (T-19).

 * is imported HERE — the one file no Node test imports — and injected downward. Everything below
 * (`bootstrap`, `Root`) names only `DbDriverFactory`, so the whole data layer runs against
 * better-sqlite3 in CI and against SQLCipher on device, through identical code.
 *
 * The op-sqlite CONFIG (`sqlcipher: true`, `performanceMode: true`) is not here and cannot be: 08
