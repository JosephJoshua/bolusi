/**
 * The composition root — the one place that knows about both the platform and the shell.
 *
 * `App` takes every input as a prop (so it is drivable from fakes); this file is what supplies them
 * on a real device. It is the only component `index.ts` registers.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS ABSENT, STATED PLAINLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   REAL:    i18n boot at the device locale (07-i18n §1.2), the notification channels
 *            (api/04-push §5), the clock/location ports, the gate + every screen, THE DATA LAYER
 *            (the SQLCipher key, the encrypted DB, client migrations, module registration, a
 *            `SyncState` READ FROM THE DATABASE), and — since task 89 — THE SYNC LOOP: when the boot
 *            reports an enrolled `deviceId` (`meta_kv`, task 88), `createSync` constructs and starts
 *            the real loop, and this component reads `loopState` / `isOffline` / `SyncState` from that
 *            LIVE client. On the first cycle `lastSuccessfulSyncAt` becomes real and the banner clears.
 *   REAL (task 92):  the ENROLLMENT PATH. `createEnrollment` wires `App`'s `onLogin`/`onEnroll` to the
 *            login + enroll transports → `runEnrollment` → the composed `CommandRuntime`'s genesis
 *            append (bootstrap/runtime.ts) over the production `OpAppendStore` → `deviceId`/`storeId`
 *            persisted (task 88). On enroll SUCCESS `onEnrolled` re-derives the enrolled `Bootstrapped`
 *            and starts the loop LIVE — no reboot — and wires the evaluator's `onBundleRefresh` memo
 *            invalidation into the bundle refresh. A FRESH device still starts unenrolled (`deviceId`
 *            null, no loop) — the true state — until the wizard runs. What stays headless-only is the
 *            on-device/on-server leg (a real POST, SQLCipher at rest), owed to task 27a (D12/D13).
 *
 * ── THE GATE IS STILL A GATE (task 24's property — do not break it) ────────────────────────────
 * `resolveZone` is a pure function of device status + session + lock, recomputed on every render,
 * "so an idle lock can't strand a screen behind a stale route". The bootstrap below does NOT touch
 * that: it resolves BEFORE any zone renders (this component returns `null` until it has), and it
 * feeds the gate's inputs rather than bypassing them. `device` is DERIVED from the real `deviceId`
 * (and `syncDisabled`), so a revoked device beats an enrolled one — the same ordering task 24 tested.
 *
 * ── THE IDLE LOCK, COMPOSED (task 133; api/02-auth §6.4, SEC-AUTH-08) ───────────────────────────
 * `locked` was the literal `false` here. The gate's third input was therefore a constant, nothing
 * called `ShellSession.tick`, and `SessionManager.checkIdle()` had no production caller at all — a
 * security control that was green in eight unit tests and inert on every device. Three lines fixed
 * it and all three are below: `locked` is DERIVED from the session snapshot, `createIdleTicker`
 * drives the check while the app is foregrounded (and once on every resume), and the responder-
 * capture wrapper resets the deadline on interaction so the lock fires on IDLE rather than on
 * elapsed time. The DECISION is still 14's — nothing here re-derives a deadline.
