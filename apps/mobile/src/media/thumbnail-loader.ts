/**
 * THE BRIDGE that makes a PULLED note's photo actually verifiable (task 120; 06 §6).
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MISSING, AND WHY IT COULD NOT BE FIXED HERE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Task 119 left `loadThumbnail` as `UNWIRED_NOTES_MEDIA`, resolving `unavailable`, and was right to:
 * 06 §6 says downloaded bytes must be "verified against `mediaRef.sha256` before display", and at
 * schemaVersion 2 the `notes.note_created` payload carried a bare `mediaId`. For a note pulled from
 * another device there was NO hash anywhere on this device — no `media_items` row, nothing in the
 * payload — so every reachable implementation of this function was either "render unverified" (which
 * §6 forbids) or "never render". Wiring it then would have meant choosing one of those.
 *
 * schemaVersion 3 carries the whole signed `mediaRef`, so the hash now arrives with the op, covered
 * by the originating device's signature (05 §2). This file is the wiring that was waiting for it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SOURCE OF THE HASH IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `ThumbnailRef` handed in comes from the note projection, which the v3 fold wrote from the
 * signed payload. It is NOT read from `media_items` here, and must never be: that row is local state
 * a rooted device, a restored backup, or another process can rewrite, so verifying a downloaded file
 * against it would verify the file against itself. `core/src/media/download.ts` makes this argument
 * at length and takes the hash as a parameter precisely to force the caller to source it correctly.
