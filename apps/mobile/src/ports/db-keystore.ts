// The SQLCipher key's SecureStore binding — `bolusi.db_encryption_key` (security-guide §6.4).
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: NOBODY PRODUCED THIS KEY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Before task 50 the key had an interface, two consumers and ZERO producers. `DbKeyStore`
// (db-client/connection.ts) declared `getDatabaseEncryptionKey()`; `openClientDb` called it; every
// other reference in the repo was a test fake. The two files that name the key point at each other:
//
//   db-client/connection.ts  — "the real SecureStore-backed `KeyStorePort` (tasks 14/24) satisfies
//                              this" — it does NOT: `KeyStorePort` (core/auth/ports.ts) declares no
//                              `getDatabaseEncryptionKey`, so `SecureStoreKeyStore` is not
//                              assignable to `DbKeyStore`. That comment was checked and corrected.
//   ports/keystore.ts        — "`bolusi.db_encryption_key` is NOT here — that belongs to
//                              security-guide §6.4 / @bolusi/db-client".
//
// Each deferred to the other and the ring closed, which is why `grep getDatabaseEncryptionKey` found
// only fakes (T-16: a mention is not a producer). This file is the producer.
//
// ── WHY HERE AND NOT IN db-client ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// §6.4 says "the wrapper is the only place the key is ever READ from SecureStore", and that property
// is preserved in shape rather than in letter: `openClientDb` is the only caller of
// `getDatabaseEncryptionKey()`, it passes the value straight to the driver, and it never returns,
// logs or stores it. The SecureStore *binding* lives here because db-client's package entry must stay
// importable under Node (its own suite and core's projection tests import it), and expo-secure-store
// is a native module that cannot load there — the same reason the op-sqlite adapter sits behind a
// subpath. 08 §3.2 puts the SecureStore bindings in `@bolusi/mobile`'s row. The residual mismatch
// between §6.4's wording and this shape is filed, not papered over — see the task Outcome.
//
// ── STORAGE CLAIM, QUALIFIED (security-guide §6.2; api/02-auth §3) ─────────────────────────────
// SecureStore is **encrypted-at-rest, app-readable** storage — NOT a non-extractable enclave. The
// app can read this key back (it must, to open the DB), so a compromise that runs as this app reads
// it. That is the documented, accepted property; the answer to a compromised device is revocation
// (api/02-auth §7), not storage magic. Do not upgrade this comment to a stronger claim.
//
// ── KEY LOSS IS DATA LOSS, BY DESIGN (§6.4) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// There is no escrow and no recovery path: SecureStore wipe / app-data clear ⇒ the DB is
// unreadable ciphertext ⇒ re-enroll and re-pull. That is what makes `ensureDatabaseEncryptionKey`'s
// read-before-generate load-bearing rather than an optimisation — see its own comment.
