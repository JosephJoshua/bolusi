/**
 * The Sync Status screen's view model (design-system §8.4/§4; 03-state-machines §8/§10;
 * 01-domain-model §5.2).
 *
 * ── THE DESIGN PROBLEM THIS FILE EXISTS TO SOLVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This screen is the app's honesty surface, and its whole job is a distinction most apps get wrong:
 *
 *     "offline — everything is saved here, this is fine"     vs     "something is actually wrong".
 *
 * In most apps those look identical: both render a red banner saying "no connection". On a device
 * that is offline BY DESIGN — a repair shop in West Papua, days between connections (D1/NFR-1001) —
 * that red banner is a lie. It alarms a cashier about the app's NORMAL operating mode, and because
 * it is always on, it trains the whole shop to ignore banners. Then the one that matters — your
 * changes were REJECTED and will never send — arrives in the same red, and nobody reads it. The
 * failure is not the red banner; it is that the red banner spent the shop's attention on nothing.
 *
 * So this model refuses to treat connectivity as health. `isOffline` is an input, never a problem.
 * The four things below are problems, and they have nothing to do with having a connection:
 *
 *   - `deviceRevoked`  — this device is blocked; nothing will EVER send again until re-enrollment.
 *   - `pushHalted`     — the local chain is broken (CHAIN_BROKEN, 05 §8); sending has STOPPED.
 *   - `rejected`       — the server refused these changes; they will never send (05 §8).
 *   - `quarantined`    — changes from another device failed verification and are being withheld.
 *
 * Each is permanent-until-a-human-acts, and each means data is not where the user thinks it is.
 * Being offline means none of those things: the work is on the device, it is safe, and it will send
 * itself. `sync.status.offline` says exactly that and says it neutrally — "Tidak ada koneksi.
 * Perubahan tersimpan di perangkat ini." (No connection. Changes are saved on this device.)
 *
 * Likewise a PENDING COUNT IS A RECEIPT, NOT A WARNING (design-system §4 rule 3: "Unsynced ≠
 * unsaved"). "3 perubahan belum terkirim" is the app telling you it is holding your work, not
 * confessing to losing it. It renders neutral, never danger, and never as a problem.
 *
 * The one honest escalation that survives all this is STALENESS (03 §8) — not "you are offline" but
 * "what is on this screen may be old". That is about the data's trustworthiness, which is the user's
 * actual question, and it escalates on a clock rather than on connectivity.

 * The screen used to hardcode `sync.rejected.title` — "Perubahan Ditolak" / "Rejected Changes" —
 * for EVERY state. A fully-synced device was headed by a report of a problem it did not have, over
 * a body reading "Semua perubahan terkirim". On the one screen whose entire job is telling a shop
 * owner whether their work is safe, that is the failure this whole model exists to prevent
 * (see the header): spending the shop's attention on nothing until nobody reads the header at all.
 *
 * It is keyed on `syncChipState` rather than `reassurance` on purpose. The chip and the title are
 * then the SAME verdict rendered twice — they cannot disagree by construction, which is the same
 * argument `syncChipState` makes for the chip vs the screen. It also gives `offline` its own title:
 * offline is an input, never a problem (the header's thesis), so it gets its own calm words instead
 * of borrowing `pending`'s.
 *
 * `sync.rejected.title` stays what it always should have been: the header of the rejected SECTION,
 * rendered only when that section renders. `attention` titles the screen `sync.status.titleAttention`
 * instead, so the phrase appears once rather than three times.
