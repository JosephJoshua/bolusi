/**
 * The shell↔surface back/leave contract (design-system §8.1; task 145).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `resolveZone` (zone.ts) is a pure GATE: it decides which top-level surface shows
 * from auth truth, and it deliberately cannot see a module surface's OWN navigation — `NotesHome`
 * owns its list→detail→editor stack privately, exactly as the enrollment wizard owns its steps. That
 * privacy is what left two ways to destroy a half-written note: Android hardware back read `home` as
 * top-of-stack and EXITED THE APP past the open editor, and any header-chrome tap unmounted the
 * surface (dropping the draft) because the shell had no way to ask "is there unsaved work down there?"
 *
 * A `SurfaceNav` is that missing question. A module surface mounted at a shell route publishes one
 * while it has somewhere to go back to internally; the shell routes hardware back and header-chrome
 * taps through it, so §8.1's "hardware back equals the header back action" holds ACROSS the module's
 * own screens and the editor's discard gate guards every leave — without a navigation library or a
 * second source of truth for "where am I" that could disagree with the auth gate.
