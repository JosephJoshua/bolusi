// The `auth_permission_denials` projection (02-permissions §7) — the FR-1045 audit trail, and the
// load-bearing applier this task exists to close: task 09 built the evaluator to emit a denial op on
// every denial, task 10 made the deny unconditional on the audit succeeding, and all of it landed in
// an op log NOTHING read back until this fold existed.
//
// ONE OP, ONE ENTITY, ONE ROW. 02 §7: `permission_denial` / "fresh UUIDv7 per op … applier inserts
// exactly one row". Each denial is its own single-op entity, so a plain INSERT is total and correct.
//
// SUPPRESSED REPEATS ARE NOT LOST. The §7 throttle emits at most one denial op per
// `(userId, permissionId, target)` per 5-minute window per device; repeats increment an in-memory
// counter FLUSHED into the next emitted op's `suppressedRepeats`. The applier's job is only to
// preserve that count — a suppressed repeat is visible AS a count on the next row, never a vanished
// attempt. The throttle is the emitter's (authz/denials.ts); this fold trusts the signed payload.

/**
 * The `auth.permission_denied` op-payload schema (02-permissions §7 owns the shape; api/02-auth §6.2
 * references it). `.strict()` per 04 §3 — an unknown key is rejected, because a client believing it
 * recorded a field the append-only log does not contain is a silent corruption of the audit.
 *
 * `reason` is `z.enum(DENIAL_REASONS)` — the SAME closed set the evaluator raises (authz/evaluate.ts),
 * imported rather than re-listed so the op schema and the evaluator cannot disagree about which
 * reasons exist (CLAUDE.md §2.8). `scopeStoreId` is `.nullable()` (present-and-null, never absent):
 * null means the check was tenant-scoped, distinct from the envelope's device `storeId`.
 *
 * THE SINGLE PAYLOAD VALIDATOR (task 100). This is now the ONLY `auth.permission_denied` validator.
 * `authz/denials.ts` once carried a hand-rolled `isPermissionDeniedPayload` written when "no task
 * owned the auth op registry"; it was strictly LOOSER than this schema — it accepted `permissionId:
 * ''` and any string `reason` (it did NOT consume `DENIAL_REASONS`), which this schema rejects via
 * `.min(1)` and `z.enum(DENIAL_REASONS)`. Task 100 deleted the predicate and repointed its two test
 * consumers here (`permissionDeniedPayload.safeParse(x).success`), so there is now exactly one shape
 * definition (CLAUDE.md §2.8) and one reason list — this one.
