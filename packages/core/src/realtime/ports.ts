// The realtime client controller's injected seams (08-stack-and-repo §3.2/§3.3; testing-guide T-6).
//
// @bolusi/core is PLATFORM-FREE (08 §3.3 rule 3): NO `ws`, NO `fetch`, NO `EventSource`, NO
// `setTimeout`. The realtime controller is *made* of sockets and time, so every one of those
// arrives here as an interface. The RN adapters that bind a real WebSocket / streaming `fetch` to
// these ports are task 24; the harness binds fakes. That is what lets the whole §12.3 fallback
// ladder run under a FakeClock with fake transports and zero sockets.
//
// A WS and an SSE stream have the SAME lifecycle from the controller's view — open, deliver text
// frames, error, close — so ONE factory shape serves both legs (two instances: `ws`, `sse`). The
// controller never sends (v0 realtime is server→client only, api/00 §12.1), so there is no `send`.
