// @bolusi/modules — the defineModule manifests (04-module-contract), and THE ONE registration list
// both apps fold from.
//
// ── ONE LIST, NOT TWO LITERALS (task 90; CLAUDE.md §2.8) ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `registerModules(list)` derives a build's permission vocabulary, its op-type→applier map AND its
// operation registry from a single module list. Before task 90 that list was hand-maintained TWICE —
// `SERVER_MODULES` in `apps/server/src/deps.ts` and `CLIENT_MODULES` in `apps/mobile/src/bootstrap/
// modules.ts` — and NOTHING checked the two agreed. They agreed only by coincidence: a task that
// appended a module to one and not the other would ship a server that folds an op type the device
// answers `UNKNOWN_TYPE` to (or the reverse), and BOTH halves typecheck, because each list is
// independently well-formed (04 §1). Only a test could see it, and no test compared the two.
//
// `ALL_MODULES` is that single source. `apps/server` and `apps/mobile` both register from it, so
// there is exactly one place to add a module and one place a deletion can happen — and when it does,
// both apps' registration suites go red off the same edit (that is the property, falsified in
// `index.test.ts` and in each app's registration suite).
//
// ── PLATFORM-FREE, SO THE SERVER CARRIES NO RN EDGE (08 §3.2) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// This entry (`@bolusi/modules`, the `.` export) imports the `platform`/`auth` manifests from
// `@bolusi/core` and the `notes` manifest from `./notes/manifest` — its definition module, not the
// `./notes` barrel (importing the barrel would pull its whole public surface into this entry's graph
// and mislabel the barrel's other re-exports as unused). All three are platform-free; this never
// touches `./notes/screens` (the RN-only surface, importable ONLY from apps/mobile —
// `bolusi/boundaries` rule 3), so the server importing `ALL_MODULES` puts no react-native edge on
// its graph. The split export is what keeps that true; do not re-export anything under `./screens`.
//
// ── THE CAST (04 §2; mirrors both apps' former per-element casts) ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `AnyModuleDefinition<DB>` is CONTRAVARIANT in `DB` (`apply(db: Kysely<DB>, …)`), so two concrete
// modules over different schemas are mutually unassignable and a heterogeneous list cannot be built
// without erasing `DB`. `never` is the shared bottom the client already used; the appliers are
// dialect-neutral (04 §2) and the T-8 applier-conformance suite is what proves each folds
// byte-identically on both engines. `apps/server` re-casts to its own generated `DB` at the import
// site. The cast lives ONCE here now, in the manifests' home, rather than per element in two apps.
